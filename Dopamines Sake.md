Dopamine's sake
=====================

Have been working on my kids school projects on plants for one full year. She is suppposed to plant a seed and water it properly till it germinates. THis is to instill a sense of responsibility and ownership in the kids behaviour. 

So on one Friday evening as soon as I returned from office, she came with her book in hand,screaming about her task.  It doesn't matter whether I have parked my scooter or removed my shoes.

#### "I need plant. DO YOU HAVE PLANT ? Do you have seeds ? " 

I was dumbstruck. My job does neither involves any kind of greenery nor it generates anything tangible that I can feel with my hands. (I am a devops engineer). Anyways.. 

#### Me: We shall get it from the grocery store. 

#### She: Does it grow?

Now I realize this is something more than shopping. I wasn't bewildered as I am always game for any DIY tasks. But this is not something I can cut, grind, file and paste together. This has a mind of its own. It grows when you feed it properly. There are many experts a.k.a farmers who have  tried doing this their whole lifetime and still miserably fail. 

#### Me: No problem. Lets grow them then. 

#### She: When does it grow?

With the usual impatience she started becoming inquisitive. 

#### Me: Lemme refresh first. 

After leaving all my work baggage behind I gave a story like narrative of how a plant grows. Right from the time a germinating seed till the flowering and fruiting stage with a lot of imagination on how the honeybees work. She was elated and I got more questions on honeybees rather than the plant. :) 

We decided on a beautiful container and filled that with sand. This is the excuse to play with mud and there emerged the neaderthals.

Then we watered it. Now comes the question of what plant. I was pushing for finding a small herb that is quick to grow. Her choice was sunflower. Dud.. Facepalm. How do I make her realize that sunflower is taller than her and wont grow in this tea cup. After hours of youtube videos we settled on <**plant name**>



Though they are first grade projects the amount of time that I spent with them had a tangible sense. The rush of dopamine that I felt
