Hydroponics - A Fascination
===========================

I am still reeling with my earlier discovery on soilless agriculture. why would one take all this pain when you plant a seed in the soil and provide it with water and let it in sunshine, then nature does its magic. The question was very intriguing.

SO I went to google for help again. On what were the benefits of soilless agriculture to soilbased agricuture.  few advantages.
Amazed and curious, I wanted to explain all this to my kid.

How to prove to my kids about it. She studies tradional way in school. Anything that is opposite to what teacher says is blasphemy.

So i had to prove it to her and there started my first hydropnics adventure.

Explain more on the first DIY.

which plant 
which technique
what kind of nutriants
etc.
