Beginners Luck
==============

My first adventure with my little champ [Dopamines Sake](url) was surprisingly successful. My wife called it <strong>'Beginners Luck'</strong>.

It was true in a way. Inspite of our inexperienced care, our little plant (my kid by now had given it a name) went through all stages of growth perfectly. Carried away by our success, we went on a growing spree. This time we planted one too many.

We tried different kinds "add a few kinds that you can substantiate with photos".

Our second attempt was not as successful. A few of them did survive but not to perfection. But most of them withered. Maybe they did not enough sun, water, nutrition or did we simply take a wide step. The probability was endless. Boom burst our balloon and we were struck with reality. What the farmers experience. It was difficult to explain this to my kid.

She had too many questions an it is my responsibilty as a father to give her the right answers. So I went to where everybody goes for help, <strong>'Google'</strong>.
Just as the problems were endless so where the solutions. And I discovered a whole new world, the most noble profession on Earth <strong>Farming</strong>.
