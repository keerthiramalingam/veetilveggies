Beginners Luck
==============

My first adventure with my little champ [Dopamines Sake](url) was surprisingly successful. My wife called it <strong>'Beginners Luck'</strong>.

It was true in a way. In spite of our inexperienced care, our little plant (my kid by now had given it a name) went through all stages of growth perfectly. Carried away by our success, we went on a planting spree. This time we planted one too many.

We tried different kinds "add a few kinds that you can substantiate with photos".

Our second attempt was not as successful. A few of them did survive but not to perfection. But most of them withered. Maybe they did not get enough sun, water, nutrition or did we simply take a wide step. The possibilities were endless. Boom!!!! Burst our balloon and we were struck with reality. What the farmerâ€™s experience!!! 

It was difficult to explain this to my kid. She had too many questions. It is my responsibility as a father to give her the right answers. So I went to where everybody goes for help, <strong>'Google'</strong>.
Just as the problems were endless so were the solutions. And I discovered a whole new world, "the most noble profession on Earth" <strong>Farming</strong>.

Farming according to the dictionary is "the business of running a Farm". So what is a Farm according to the dictionary? The dictionary gives many meanings for a Farm.
<ol><li>A tract of land, usually with a house, barn, silo, etc., on which crops and often livestock are raised for livelihood.</li><li>Land or water devoted to the raising of animals, fish, plants, etc.: a pig farm; an oyster farm; a tree farm.</li>
<li>A similar, usually commercial, site where a product is manufactured or cultivated: a cheese farm; a honey farm.</li></ol>

Most of these meanings related to agriculture refer to requiring a land to grow plants. But Google tells me otherwise!! We can roughly classify agriculture as soil based and soilless agriculture. Soilless agriculture!!! Wow!!! This breaks my traditional understanding of farming.

We all know soil based agriculture (though we may not be masters at it). So I dived deep into learning about soilless agriculture. Hydroponics, aquaponics and aeroponics are types of soilless agriculture. 
<ol><li>Hydroponics is growing plants in water. The water is supplemented with the required nutrients</li><li>Aquaponics is a variant of Hydroponics. Here the water also has fishes which provide the nutrition for the plant instead of adding nutrients by external means</li><li>Aeroponics has no growing medium. In the above two methods the growing medium is water. In aeroponics, the plant is suspended in air and are sprayed with nutrient mist</li></ol>

Wow!! What a discovery. Truly overwhelming!!!
